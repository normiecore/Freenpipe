# Open questions

Spec ambiguities resolved during implementation: the question, the decision taken and why. Grouped by
work package.

## W0-07

- **Key family for BYO client credentials.** connections.md suggests `oauth-client:<id>`, cloud-018 and
  PLAN.md say `oauth_client:<id>`. Decision: `oauth_client:<integration_id>`, holding
  `{client_id, client_secret?, redirect_uri?}`. Reason: PLAN.md names cloud-018 as canonical; the
  underscore also keeps the rows outside the `oauth:` token prefix the refresh scheduler scans.
- **Extra `OAuthConfig` fields.** The plan names only `token_url` and `uses_pkce`. Decision: also add
  `token_auth` (client_secret_post or client_secret_basic), `token_body` (form or JSON) and
  `requires_https_redirect`, and drop `client_id` and `redirect_uri_override`. Reason: Notion, Zoom,
  Intuit and Supabase want HTTP Basic client authentication, Notion and Atlassian document JSON bodies,
  the vendor client ids are useless without the vendor's secret, and the override only ever held the
  vendor relay.
- **HTTPS-only providers (Slack, Zoom, Calendly, QuickBooks).** Decision: there is no default redirect
  for them; the OAuth app dialog requires a redirect URI, and saving without one fails with an
  explanation. Any `https://` URL or a loopback `http://` URL is accepted. Reason: the spec asks for a
  user-supplied relay with no Freenpipe-hosted one; accepting an explicit loopback URL keeps Intuit
  development keys (which allow localhost) usable, and the provider itself rejects what it does not allow.
- **Which providers get PKCE.** Decision: on for Google, Microsoft (365 and Teams), Zoom, Calendly and
  Supabase; off for Notion, GitHub, Slack, Atlassian, Cal.com, Intuit and Vercel. Reason: enabled where
  the provider documents S256 support; RFC 6749 servers ignore unknown parameters, but staying
  conservative avoids surprises with strict endpoints.
- **Cal.com token endpoint.** The spec asks to verify it against current Cal.com docs; the cloud VM has
  no route to cal.com. Decision: `https://app.cal.com/api/auth/oauth/token`, form body, client secret in
  the body. Reason: best available knowledge; a smoke test with a real Cal.com app should confirm it and
  whether refreshes need a different path.
- **Default loopback port.** `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` hard-codes port 3030. Decision: the app builds the
  default redirect from the port the embedded engine was started on; before the engine exists it falls
  back to a valid `SCREENPIPE_PORT` (the override `to_recording_config` applies), then the stored
  `recording.port`, then 3030. The dialog shows the exact URI to register, and connect sends the same
  one. Reason: dev builds run on 3035 through `SCREENPIPE_PORT` while settings keep 3030, and a 3030
  redirect would land where no Freenpipe engine listens (or on an installed screenpipe).
- **MCP OAuth redirect.** Decision: `POST /mcp-servers/:id/oauth/start` accepts a `redirect_uri` only when
  it is the loopback `/mcp-servers/<id>/oauth/callback` of this engine; the default takes its port from
  a loopback `Host` header (else 3030); an `app_scheme` field is ignored. Reason: the plan keeps MCP OAuth
  on the local callback, and the old code passed any caller-supplied redirect through.
- **Refresh without an OAuth app.** Decision: the background scheduler skips such tokens (counted as
  `refreshes_skipped`, no failure cooldown), and on-demand refresh fails with a "no OAuth app is
  configured" error. Removing an OAuth app keeps existing tokens. Reason: the fix is in settings, not in
  waiting; deleting tokens on app removal would lose identity metadata the user may want back.
- **Google's dedicated cards.** Decision: the OAuth app block is rendered above the Google Calendar, Docs,
  Sheets and Gmail cards from `connections-section.tsx`, which also passes each card a
  `connectBlockedReason` prop (from `connectBlocker`). Inside the cards the changes are that prop, which
  disables the connect / add-account button with the reason as its tooltip, and an error toast on the
  Gmail, Docs and Sheets connect buttons, as the Calendar card already had. Reason: cloud-018 asks for a
  disabled OAuth button with guidance; the cards are outside this WP's owner paths, but no other WP owns
  them, and with user-entered credentials a missing or rejected OAuth app is the common failure.
- **Other OAuth connect surfaces.** The onboarding "connect apps" tiles and the pipe post-install
  connections dialog call `oauth_connect` too and dropped an error result silently. Decision: both now
  show the backend message (the onboarding tile stays in its error state until clicked again; the dialog
  prints it under the connect button), which names Settings > Connections when no OAuth app is set up.
  They do not embed the OAuth app form. Reason: the smallest change that gives the guidance cloud-018
  asks for in files other WPs own in other regions (W0-05, W0-09, W4-07 for `connect-apps.tsx`; W2-20
  for `post-install-connections-modal.tsx`).
- **`oauth:` rows outside the registry.** `oauth:chatgpt` (and any future non-registry row) sits under the
  token prefix the refresh scheduler scans. Decision: the scheduler treats "not a registry OAuth
  integration" like "no OAuth app": skipped, not counted as a failure, no cooldown. Reason: those rows
  are refreshed by their own flows, and failing them every tick only produces warnings.
- **Tokens carried over from screenpipe.** Drop-in data dirs can hold `oauth:<id>` tokens that the
  vendor's OAuth apps issued, and a refresh token only works for the client that obtained it. Decision:
  no conversion. Until an OAuth app is entered the scheduler skips them; afterwards the first refresh
  fails with the provider's grant or client error, the normal failure cooldown applies, and the user
  reconnects. Reason: nothing local can re-bind a grant to another client, and the vendor's secrets are
  not available.
- **Errors when no OAuth app is stored.** Decision: `describe_oauth_error` (used by the Gmail, Google
  Calendar and proxy routes) adds a sentence saying no OAuth app is configured, except in the
  multiple-accounts case, and only when a SecretStore is available to check. Reason: "reconnect it" alone
  sends the user round a loop that cannot succeed without an app; the CLI has no store, so it cannot tell.
